## Summary
This project aims to predict the "classe" variable using machine learning techniques on the provided dataset. Key steps include:

1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection:
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    - Remove unnecessary variables (such as those with too many NAs).

2. Model Training:
    - Training and visualizing a Decision Tree model with rpart (with 10-fold cross-validation).
    - Training a Random Forest model using 10-fold cross-validation with the caret package.

3. Out-of-Sample Error Estimation:
    - The superior Random Forests model achieve an out-of-sample error rate of only 0.71%. (99.29% accuracy)

4. Results & Conclusion:
    - Emphasizing the effectiveness of the superior performance of Random Forests in predicting the "classe" variable.

## Prepare Data and Packages
```{r, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
library(rpart.plot)

url1 <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
url2 <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
download.file(url1, destfile = "./data/training.csv")
download.file(url2, destfile = "./data/testing.csv")

training <- read_csv("./data/training.csv")
testing <- read_csv("./data/testing.csv")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

According to the research paper, there are 5 different fashions of performing Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl:

- Class A: exactly according to the specification
- Class B: throwing the elbows to the front
- Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway
- Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway
- Class E: throwing the hips to the front

These are recorded in the `classe` variable in the given data set, which is the outcome variable in this course project.

```{r}
ggplot(training, aes(x = training$classe)) +
    geom_bar()
```

|   A  |   B  |   C  |   D  |   E  |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 5580 | 3797 | 3422 | 3216 | 3607 |

Out of 19622 observations in the training set, 5580 of them (28%) are Class A, which corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise.

## Feature Selection & Data Processing

In this step, I will:

(1) remove variables that have a large amount of missing values.
(2) remove variables that are individual-specific: `...1`, `user_name`, `raw_timestamp_part_1`, `raw_timestamp_part_2`, `cvtd_timestamp`, `new_window`, and `num_window`.
(3) remove near zero variance variables, which are not useful for prediction.
(4) turn the output variable `classe` into a factor variable.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
na_percentage <- colSums(is.na(training)) / nrow(training)
training_r <- training %>% 
    select(which(na_percentage<0.5)) %>% #(1)
    select(-c(1:7)) #(2) 

nzv <- nearZeroVar(training_r)
training_r <- training_r %>%
    select(-nzv) #(3)

training_r$classe <- as.factor(training$classe) #(4)
```

## Create training set and testing set
```{r}
set.seed(24)
index_train <- createDataPartition(training_r$classe, p = 0.7, list = F) 
train_data <- training_r[index_train,]
test_data <- training_r[-index_train,]
```

In this project, I employ two kinds of model. The first is *Decision Trees*, and then the more sophisticated *Random Forest*

## Decision Trees

#### Step 1: Configure Cross-validation & Fit the model
```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(357)
fitControl_dt <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
dtModel <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_data, method = "rpart", 
                 trControl = fitControl_dt, 
                 tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0.01, 0.1, 0.01)))
```
I use a 10-fold cross validation here. Cross validation is used to estimate the out of sample error rate. By holding out a part of the training data for validation in each iteration, cross-validation provides a robust estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The average validation error across all folds provides a more stable and reliable estimate of the out-of-sample error rate than a single train-test split.

#### Step 2: Visualize the model
```{r}
rpart.plot(dtModel$finalModel)
```

#### Step 3 Predict on the test set
```{r}
set.seed(11)
prediction1 <- predict(dtModel, test_data)
confusionMatrix(prediction1, test_data$classe)
```
The result accuracy is 74%, which corresponds to an out-of-sample error rate of 26%.


## Random Forest

#### Step 1: Configure Cross-validation and parallel processing
```{r}
set.seed(246)
cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1) # convention to leave 1 core for OS
registerDoParallel(cluster)
fitControl_rf <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, allowParallel = TRUE)
```
Again, I use a 10-fold cross validation here. Cross validation is used to estimate the out of sample error rate. By holding out a part of the training data for validation in each iteration, cross-validation provides a robust estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The average validation error across all folds provides a more stable and reliable estimate of the out-of-sample error rate than a single train-test split.

In addition, to speed up processing time, I utilize parallel processing as instructed by course mentor Len Greski. See here: <https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-randomForestPerformance.md>


#### Step 2: Develop a random forest model
```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(22)
rfModel <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_data, method = "rf", trControl = fitControl_rf, ntree = 100)
stopCluster(cluster)
registerDoSEQ()
```

#### Step 3: Examine model summary and cross-validation results
```{r}
print(rfModel)
print(rfModel$resample)
```

#### Step 4: Predict on the test set
```{r}
prediction2 <- predict(rfModel, test_data)
confusionMatrix(prediction2, test_data$classe)
```
*The accuracy of the Random Forest model is an excellent 99.29%.*

## Results - Out of sample error
The random forest model performed exceptionally well. When applied to the test dataset, which was not used during the model building process, the model accurately predicted 99.29% of the cases, misclassifying only 42 out of 5,885 observations. Out-of-sample error rate is only 0.71%.


## Predict on the original test set. (20 observations)
```{r}
predict(rfModel, newdata = testing)
```
The accuracy is 100% in predicting the 20 unknown test cases.
